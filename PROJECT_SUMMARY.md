### 6. Full-Stack Architecture
- Frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI
- Backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- RESTful API architecture
- Modular code organization

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material UI
- **Drag-and-Drop**: React DnD
- **Key Pages**: 
  - Builder Page (main design interface)
  - Settings Page (database and logic management)

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints
- **Key Services**:
  - Website management
  - Page and component management
  - AI services integration
  - Deployment services

### AI Integration
- Content generation
- Code generation
- Layout optimization
- Chat assistant functionality

## Project Structure

The application is organized into two main parts:

```
ai-website-builder/
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── pages/          # Main application pages
│   │   ├── services/       # API services
│   │   ├── store/          # Redux store
│   │   └── types/          # TypeScript types
│   └── public/             # Static assets
└── backend/
    ├── controllers/        # Request handlers
    ├── models/             # Database models
    ├── routes/             # API routes
    ├── services/           # Business logic
    └── server.ts           # Main server file
```

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
2. **Development**: Run both servers concurrently
3. **Building**: Use the drag-and-drop interface to create websites
4. **Editing**: Modify component properties through the editor
5. **Exporting**: Generate production-ready code
6. **Deploying**: Publish to hosting platforms with one click

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation, several enhancements could be made:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and login system
2. **Template Library**: Create a library of pre-built templates
3. **Collaborative Features**: Enable multiple users to work on the same project
4. **Advanced AI**: Integrate more sophisticated AI models for better suggestions
5. **Custom Domains**: Allow users to connect custom domains
6. **Analytics**: Add website analytics dashboard
7. **Performance Optimization**: Improve loading times and responsiveness
8. **Mobile Editor**: Create a mobile-friendly editing interface

## Conclusion

This AI-Powered Full-Stack Website Builder successfully addresses the challenge of enabling non-technical founders to create and deploy web applications without coding knowledge. The platform combines visual design tools with AI-assisted code generation to provide a comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between idea and implementation.

The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization, making it a strong foundation for further development and commercialization.
